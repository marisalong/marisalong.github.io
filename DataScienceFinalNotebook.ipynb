    "Our team was interested in working with datasets related to Alzheimer's disease, particularly taken from studies measuring features of dementia patients such as years of education, brain volumetrics, age of diagnosis and death, and more. We are particularly interested in working with datasets relating to Alzheimer's and dementia because both of our families have both been personally impacted by the disease. \n",
    "\n",
    "Alzheimer's disease impacts families across the globe and is the leading cause of dementia in aging populations. Alzheimer's is a neurological disease that is most widely recognized as progressive memory loss. However, Alzheimer's can have a host of other impacts on patients, including paranoia, delusions, self injurious behaviors and depression, and difficulty speaking, swallowing, and walking. Given the detrimental outcomes of Alzheimer's disease, families are often left with the burden of personally caring for patients or finding palliative care options. Families might suffer the physical and emotional burdens of caregiving, as well as the guilt and pain associated with watching a loved one progressively lose themselves. To put it simply, hundreds of thousands of people are diagnosed with Alzheimer's each year, and research on the disease is still riddled with unanswered question and lack of clarity in terms of predictive features and treatment options. There is a push in the field to start [implementing Machine Learning models](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2022.853294/full) and other computer/data science methods as a means of predicting Alzheimer's diagnoses. We wanted to engage in our own data analysis with this in mind. \n",
    "\n",
    "For the purpose of this project, we will be seeking to evaluate the relationships that exist between these patient features and the onset of symptoms and diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. We were most interested in looking at features such as education and gender at the offset of our research, but we also wanted to keep our mind open to other predictive features based on our exploratory analysis. We are interested in getting a sense of both where research dead-ends in terms of predictive modeling as well as potentially discovering more promising areas where research might be headed. Though we do recognize that our lack of expertise in the field may be a barrier to our analyses, we hope to use of data science skills to explore some potential areas to research further rather than claiming to try to understand the intricacies of the neuroscientific data.

    "## **Discussion of Data Sources**\n",
    "The first dataset that we determined was fit for our project is [MRI and Alzheimer's](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jboysen/mri-and-alzheimers), taken from the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS). OASIS is a project that has sought to make brain imaging datasets more widely available to the public. This dataset includes MRI comparisons of adults with Alzheimer's and healthy adults. This dataset was initially interesting to our team because the this dataset has a high data usability score as assigned by Kaggle, which represents user ratings on the documentation of the data. This high score indicates that the data is in a state ready for our analysis. This dataset also includes both cross-sectional and longitudinal MRI data. The cross-sectional data highlights 416 subjects ranging from age 18 to 96 and details 3 to 4 MRI scans for each subject. Approximately $1\\over4$ of the subjects had been diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. <mark> The longitudinal data follows a sample of 150 subjects aged 60 to 96. *__are we sure this is right? why does it say the patients 190 nondemented, 146 demented and 37 converted below?__*</mark> These same 150 subjects were scanned two or more times with at least a year between imaging sessions. 64 of the subjects were diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease by the time of the first scan with an additional 14 diagnosed at one of the later scan visits. Using this data, we are hoping to be able to answer questions regarding the ability to predict dementia in patients based on features such as socioeconomic status or education. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Was education a predictive feature for individuals who had dementia at the time of their first scan or who were diagnosed with dementia over the course of the study?\n",
    "- Was scioeconomic status a predictor for Alzheimer's?\n"

   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "For our second dataset, we wanted to dive further into brain difference between females and males that could contribute to differences in the prevalence of dementia. We also continued to explore correlations between years of education and dementia onset. For this milestone, we performed exploratory analysis on the [Seattle Alzheimer's Disease Brain Cell Atlas Donor Metadata dataset](https://portal.brain-map.org/explore/seattle-alzheimers-disease/seattle-alzheimers-disease-brain-cell-atlas-download?edit&language=en). This dataset was taken from studies conducted by the Allen Institute for Brain Science, the University of Washington, and the Kaiser Permanente Washington Health Research Institute. The data highlights demographic, clinical, cognitive, and neuropathological data for a set of 84 patients. The patient features include cognitive status, level and years of education, sex, race, brain pH, measures from numerous brain scans, and ages at different stages in each patients cognitive journey. We found this dataset particularly interesting since there is also a separate volumetric dataset that can be linked using the donor ID. For the purpose of our exploratory analysis, we did not use the volumetric dataset as neither of us have the neuroscience expertise to understand the complexity of these measures, but we did plan to incorporate it into our analysis if we saw fit in the future. Using the metadata we initially explored, we hope to answer questions such as the following:\n",
    "- Are there size, density, or chemical differences between sexes that may contribute to the onset of Alzheimer’s or other dementias?\n",
    "- Are the number of years of education or the education level a predictive feature for the onset of dementia? If so, is a predictive feature of when the onset will occur?\n",
    "\n",
    "This second question is especially interesting to us because we want to see if our findings are consistent with our analysis from the first dataset regarding education as a potential predictive feature. "

Looking at education differences among clinically demented vs nondemented individuals will help us determine how strongly education level may predict Alhzeimer's."

However, when we read the publication that came out alongside this dataset, they authors explained that 'SES' is ranked using the Hollingshead Index of Social Position and has 1 being the highest status, where 5 is the lowest. Therefore, this statistic shows that individuals from a higher socioeconomic status were likely to recieve more education than those of lower socioeconomic statuses. Through our further exploration, we hope to uncover the relationship between socioeconomic status, education, and dementia."

    "Based on this exploratory graph, there are several observations that can be made about brain pH as it relates to dementia diagnosis. For individuals with dementia, the mode appears at individuals with pH around 6.2-6.3, whereas individuals without dementia appear to have a peak for individuals with a brain pH around 6.9. Ignoring the distinct outlier in the dementia patients, the spread of patients with and without dementia is around 1.5. However, the maximum pH for individuals without dementia is higher at around 7.6, whereas the max pH for individuals with dementia falls at around 7.2. We wanted to consider brain pH as it relates to dementia because brain pH may be a potential indicating factor for dementia, and we know that females tend to have a lower brain pH. "

    "From these two plots, it appears that brain pH is lower in the individuals with dementia. For instance, although males tend to lean towards a higher pH in both the demented and non-demented group, in the non-demented group the highest male brain pH is around 7.6 where it is around 7.3 in the demented group. Females tended to have a slightly lower brain pH in both groups, with the non-demented group having a low of about 6.0 and the demented group having a lot of around 4.4. We found this particularly interesting that females appear to have a slightly lower baseline pH compared to men and that brain pH appears to fall with dementia. At this point, we have to keep digging further to see if brain pH is a good predictor for dementia. If so, we will do more research on pH between females and males to see if baseline brain pH could contribute to the likelihood of developing dementia."

We also were able to see that our new dataset contains individuals who had a lower score on average, since each respective mean was lower than the means of MMSE per group in the three combined datasets We will have to do a bit more research into exactly what a point in the MMSE score represents to better understand these differences."

    "This exploratory plot suggests that, in this dataset, there does not appear to be a correlation with years of education and the age of dementia diagnosis. We have to take this with a grain of salt because a large amount of the data had to be dropped because there was no age of diagnosis recorded. However, this is definitely something worth exploring more because it plays into our question regarding the correlations between education and dementia diagnosis. "

    "Our initial hope when beginning this project was to see if there were correlations between gender, socioeconomic status, level of education, and the onset of Alzheimer’s or other dementias. Through our EDA, we have seen that without massive amounts of data, it may be difficult to build a predictive model since each human is so variable. However, by exploring the strongest correlations and combining them, we still hope to be able to build a working model.\n",

    "#### Challenges with MRI Dataset: Comparisions Across Datasets\n",
    "1. ***Different Columns (Variables):*** The longitudinal data and cross-sectional data contained slightly different varibles from one another. For example, 'Group' only existed in one dataframe, so we had to map the Clinical Dementia Rating for each patient found in the cross-sectional data to their correpsonding group. \n",
    "2. ***'EDUC' Ambiguity:*** In the longitudinal data, the paper that was published alongside the dataset clearly states that Education Level means the number of years in formal education for that individual. However, in the cross-sectional data, the 'Educ' numbers are suspiciously low for being total years in formal education, education may be measured differently there. We must continue to dig into what the connection between these two variables may be.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Challenges with Metadata Dataset:\n",
    "1. ***Relatively Small Sample Size:*** One of the biggest things we have taken out of our analysis of this dataset is that we have to be cautious how much weight we put on any conclusions from this dataset. Only 84 participants are included in this data. We really liked this source because there aren't a lot of sources available publicly that have information on education and gender as they relate to dementia. However, we do recognize that this is one downfall of this dataset. We hope that in our future work we will be able to mitigate this by working with both of our datasets, and if we decide it is necessary at that point, we will figure out another dataset to draw from. \n",
    "2. ***Lack of Knowledge in the Field:*** This dataset included a lot of test scores and other information that has the potential to be useful in our analyses. We did begin looking some of them up to get a better sense of what might be useful to use in the future, but since our previous EDA focused most on gender and education, we decided to stick to the columns relating to these for the time being. \n",
    "3. ***Missing Data*** One example of a piece of missing data is that for several of the age columns, the ages above 90 are grouped together whereas all the other ages are only representative of a singular year. This made it so that those columns were not integers which complicated our task of graphing and getting summary statistics. To deal with this, we changed those \"90+\" categories to all just be equal to 90, which might not be a long term solution but provided us with the ability to conduct our exploratory analyses.   "
