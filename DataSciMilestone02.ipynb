Meeting in person once a week will ensure that we are able to adequately communicate and delegate what each of us are working on and assist each other as necessary. We created a shared Github repository as our means of maintaining version control and collaboration for the project. The project board within our repository includes our to-do tasks so we are able to track our progress. "

    "Our team is interested in working with datasets related to Alzheimer's disease measuring features of patients such as clinical dimension rating, years of education, normalized whole brain volume, age, socioeconomic status, and more. We are particularly interested in working with datasets relating to Alzheimer's because our families have both been personally impacted by the disease. We are currently considering working with two particular datasets that we have uncovered in our search."

    "The  dataset that we performed some initial EDA on for the first milestone is [MRI and Alzheimer's](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jboysen/mri-and-alzheimers) taken from the [Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS)](http://www.oasis-brains.org/). This dataset includes MRI comparisons of adults with Alzheimer's and healthy adults. This dataset was initially interesting to our team because the this dataset has a high data usability score as assigned by Kaggle, which represents user ratings on the documentation of the data. This high score indicates that the data is in a state ready for our analysis. This dataset also includes both cross-sectional and longitudinal MRI data. The cross-sectional data highlights 416 subjects ranging from age 18 to 96 and details 3 to 4 MRI scans for each subject. Approximately $1\\over4$ of the subjects had been diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. The longitudinal data follows the same sample of 150 subjects aged 60 to 96. These subjects were scanned two or more times with at least a year between imaging sessions. 64 of the subjects were diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease by the time of the first scan with an additional 14 diagnosed at one of the later scan visits. Using this data, we are hoping to be able to answer questions regarding the ability to predict dementia in patients based on features such as socioeconomic status or education. For example:\n",
    "- Was education a predictive feature for individuals who had dementia at the time of their first scan or who were diagnosed with dementia over the course of the study? \n",
    "- Was scioeconomic status a predictor for Alhziemer's?"

    "At first glance, a strong negative correlation between education level and socioeconomic status was suprising. However, when we read the publication that came out alongside this dataset, they authors explained that 'SES' is ranked using the Hollingshead Index of Social Position and has 1 being the highest status, where 5 is the lowest. Therefore, this statistic shows that individuals from a higher socioeconomic status were likely to recieve more education than those of lower socioeconomic statuses. Through our further exploration, we hope to uncover the relationship between socioeconomic status, education, and dementia."

For individuals with dementia, the mode appears at individuals with pH around 6.2-6.3, whereas individuals without dementia appear to have a peak  for individuals with a brain pH around 6.9. Ignoring the distinct outlier in the dementia patients, the spread of patients with and without dementia is around 1.5.

    "1. ***Different Columns (Variables):*** The longitudinal data and cross-sectional data contained slightly different varibles from one another. For example, 'Group' only existed in one dataframe, so we had to map the Clinical Dementia Rating for each patient found in the cross-sectional data to their correpsonding group. \n",
    "2. ***'EDUC' Ambiguity:*** In the longitudinal data, the paper that was published alongside the dataset clearly states that Education Level means the number of years in formal education for that individual. However, in the cross-sectional data, the 'Educ' numbers are suspiciously low for being total years in formal education, education may be measured differently there. We must continue to dig into what the connection between these two variables may be.\n",

    "####  Plan Moving Forward and What We Still Need\n",
    "\n",
    "From here, we plan to focus on the the second dataset, which includes two dataframes of cross-sectional and longitudinal data. Our plan is to test whether there are statistically significant differences between gender and Alhzeimer's that have a across education and socioeconomic status. To supplement this data, we would like to find a dataset that contains more information on the relationships between socioeconomic status and education (perhaps breaks down this relationship into finer detail). We also plan to see if there are any gendered differences in dementia onset. Above, we began this exploration with looking at the age of onset. We plan to continue doing this at brain volume in comparision across genders and it's relation to dementia, although it would be helpful to find a dataset that included white matter mass."
