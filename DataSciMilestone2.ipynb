Meeting in person once a week will ensure that we are able to adequately communicate and delegate what each of us are working on and assist each other as necessary. We created a shared Github repository as our means of maintaining version control and collaboration for the project. The project board within our repository includes our to-do tasks so we are able to track our progress. "

    "## **Discussion of Datasets**\n",
    "Our team is interested in working with datasets related to Alzheimer's disease measuring features of patients such as clinical dimension rating, years of education, normalized whole brain volume, age, socioeconomic status, and more. We are particularly interested in working with datasets relating to Alzheimer's because our families have both been personally impacted by the disease. We are currently considering working with two particular datasets that we have uncovered in our search. \n",
    "\n",
    "The first dataset that we are considering working with is [Alzheimer's Disease and Healthy Aging Indicators: Cognitive Decline](https://chronicdata.cdc.gov/Healthy-Aging/Alzheimer-s-Disease-and-Healthy-Aging-Indicators-C/jhd5-u276) from the [Centers for Disease Control](https://www.cdc.gov/aging/index.html) (CDC). This dataset is a filtered version of a larger [Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System](https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/index.html) (BRFSS) dataset to include only information on mental decline relevant to our project. We are interested in using this dataset because the CDC has access to a large volume of data related to Alzheimer's, which will allow us to have a  broad view of the features we might be able to work with as we narrow down our project scope. Another interesting aspect of this dataset is that the CDC has recorded information regarding both healthy individuals and diseased individuals. Using this data, we are hoping to be able to answer questions regarding health-related behaviors, chronic health dianoses, and the use of various health-related services as broken down by age, gender, race, and state, to name a few. \n",
    "For example:\n",
    "- Is gender a predictive feature of Alzheimer's disease in older adults?\n",
    "- Does race/ethnicity play a role?\n"

For individuals with dementia, the mode appears at individuals with pH around 6.2-6.3, whereas individuals without dementia appear to have a peak for individuals with a brain pH around 6.9. Ignoring the distinct outlier in the dementia patients, the spread of patients with and without dementia is around 1.5. However, the maximum pH for individuals without dementia is higher at around 7.6, whereas the max pH for individuals with dementia falls at around 7.2."

    "This exploratory plot suggests that, in this dataset, there does not appear to be a correlation with years of education and the age of dementia diagnosis. We have to take this with a grain of salt because a large amount of the data had to be dropped because there was no age of diagnosis recorded. However, this is definitely something worth exploring more and plays into our question regarding the correlations between education and dementia diagnosis. "

    "1. ***Different Columns (Variables):*** The longitudinal data and cross-sectional data contained slightly different varibles from one another. For example, 'Group' only existed in one dataframe, so we had to map the Clinical Dementia Rating for each patient found in the cross-sectional data to their correpsonding group. \n",
    "2. ***'EDUC' Ambiguity:*** In the longitudinal data, the paper that was published alongside the dataset clearly states that Education Level means the number of years in formal education for that individual. However, in the cross-sectional data, the 'Educ' numbers are suspiciously low for being total years in formal education, education may be measured differently there. We must continue to dig into what the connection between these two variables may be.\n",

    "####  Plan Moving Forward and What We Still Need\n",

    "From here, we plan to focus on the the second dataset, which includes two dataframes of cross-sectional and longitudinal data. Our plan is to test whether there are statistically significant differences between gender and Alhzeimer's that have a across education and socioeconomic status. To supplement this data, we would like to find a dataset that contains more information on the relationships between socioeconomic status and education (perhaps breaks down this relationship into finer detail). We also plan to see if there are any gendered differences in dementia onset. Above, we began this exploration with looking at the age of onset. We plan to continue doing this at brain volume in comparision across genders and it's relation to dementia, although it would be helpful to find a dataset that included white matter mass."
