Meeting in person once a week will ensure that we are able to adequately communicate and delegate what each of us are working on and assist each other as necessary. We created a shared Github repository as our means of maintaining version control and collaboration for the project. The project board within our repository includes our to-do tasks so we are able to track our progress. "

    "### **Discussion of Datasets**\n",
    "Our team is interested in working with datasets related to Alzheimer's disease measuring features of patients such as clinical dimension rating, years of education, normalized whole brain volume, age, socioeconomic status, and more. We are particularly interested in working with datasets relating to Alzheimer's because our families have both been personally impacted by the disease. We are currently considering working with two particular datasets that we have uncovered in our search. \n",
    "\n",
    "The first dataset that we are considering working with is [Alzheimer's Disease and Healthy Aging Indicators: Cognitive Decline](https://chronicdata.cdc.gov/Healthy-Aging/Alzheimer-s-Disease-and-Healthy-Aging-Indicators-C/jhd5-u276) from the [Centers for Disease Control](https://www.cdc.gov/aging/index.html) (CDC). This dataset is a filtered version of a larger [Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System](https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/index.html) (BRFSS) dataset to include only information on mental decline relevant to our project. The BRFSS data includes data regarding health-related behaviors, chronic health dianoses, and the use of various health-related services. We are interested in using this dataset because the CDC has access to a large volume of data related to Alzheimer's, which will allow us to have a  broad view of the features we might be able to work with as we narrow down our project scope. Another interesting aspect of this dataset is that the CDC has recorded information regarding both healthy individuals and diseased individuals. Using this data, we are hoping to be able to answer \n",

    "The second dataset that we are considering working with is [MRI and Alzheimer's](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jboysen/mri-and-alzheimers) taken from the [Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS)](http://www.oasis-brains.org/). This dataset includes MRI comparisons of adults with Alzheimer's and healthy adults. This dataset was initially interesting to our team because the this dataset has a high data usability score as assigned by Kaggle, which represents user ratings on the documentation of the data. This high score indicates that the data is in a state ready for our analysis. This dataset also includes both cross-sectional and longitudinal MRI data. The cross-sectional data highlights 416 subjects ranging from age 18 to 96 and details 3 to 4 MRI scans for each subject. Approximately $1\\over4$ of the subjects had been diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. The longitudinal data follows the same sample of 150 subjects aged 60 to 96. These subjects were scanned two or more times with at least a year between imaging sessions. 64 of the subjects were diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease by the time of the first scan with an additional 14 diagnosed at one of the later scan visits.
